NAME
    Data::BT::PhoneBill - Parse a BT Phone Bill from their web site

SYNOPSIS
      my $bill = Data::BT::PhoneBill->new($filename);

      while (my $call = $bill->next_call) {
        print $call->date, $call->time, $call->destination,
              $call->number, $call->duration, $call->type, $call->cost;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an interface for querying your BT phone bill, as
    produced from their "View My Bill" service at http://www.bt.com/

    You should use their "Download Calls" option to save your bill as a CSV
    file, and then feed it to this module.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
      my $bill = Data::BT::PhoneBill->new($filename);

    Parses the bill stored in $filename.

FETCHING DATA
      while (my $call = $bill->next_call) {
        print $call->date, $call->time, $call->destination,
              $call->number, $call->duration, $call->type, $call->cost;
        }
      }

    Each time you call $bill->next_call it will return a
    Data::BT::PhoneBill::_Call object representing a telephone call (or
